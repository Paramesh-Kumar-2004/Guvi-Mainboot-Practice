# 🚀 JavaScript Basics – Arrays, Loops, Functions & Conditions

This repository provides a beginner-friendly introduction to **JavaScript programming**, focusing on four essential topics: **Arrays**, **Loops (For)**, **Functions**, and **Conditions**.

---

## 📂 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Arrays
- Store multiple values in a single variable.
- Enable easy access, iteration, and manipulation of data.
- Fundamental for managing collections in JavaScript.

---

### 🔹 Loops (For Loop)
- Execute code repeatedly.
- The **for loop** is ideal when the number of iterations is known.
- Useful for iterating over arrays and performing repetitive tasks.

---

### 🔹 Functions
- Reusable blocks of code for specific tasks.
- Enhance code reusability, readability, and modularity.
- Accept parameters and can return results.

---

### 🔹 Conditions
- Make decisions in programs.
- Run different code blocks based on conditions.
- Use statements like `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
