# 🚀 JavaScript Basics – Arrays, Loops, Functions & Conditions

This repository contains fundamental concepts of **JavaScript programming** that are essential for beginners.  
It focuses on four key areas: **Arrays, Loops (For), Functions, and Conditions**.

---

## 📂 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Arrays

- Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
- They allow easy access, iteration, and manipulation of data.
- Arrays form the foundation for handling collections of elements in JavaScript.

---

### 🔹 Loops (For Loop)

- Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.
- The **for loop** is the most common, used when the number of iterations is known.
- Helps in iterating through arrays, sequences, or performing repetitive tasks.

---

### 🔹 Functions

- Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
- They improve code reusability, readability, and modularity.
- Functions can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs (results).

---

### 🔹 Conditions

- Conditional statements help in decision-making within programs.
- They execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.
- Commonly used conditions include `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
